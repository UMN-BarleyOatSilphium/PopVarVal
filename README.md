PopVarVal
=========

Description
-----------

Project repository for the empirical validation of PopVar. This experiment involved predicting the genetic variance (*V*<sub>*G*</sub>) and superior progeny mean (*Î¼*<sub>*s**p*</sub>) of a large number of simulated bi-parental crosses. Those simulated crosses with high and low predicted *V*<sub>*G*</sub> were selected and were actually created. The families will be evaluated in field trials in 2017 and 2018.
