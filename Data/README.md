Data
====

Below are instructions for obtaining from the [Triticeae Toolbox (T3)](https://triticeaetoolbox.org/barley) the data used in this study. These instructions work as of 27 November, 2018.

Training population and parent candidates
-----------------------------------------

### Genomewide marker data

Currently, the genomewide marker data is not available on T3. Please [email me](neyha001@umn.edu) to obtain this data.

### Phenotype data

1.  Go to <https://triticeaetoolbox.org/barley>.
2.  Under the "Select" tab, go to "Wizard (Lines, Traits, Trials)".
3.  Fill in the following information in the selection prompts:
    -   Breeding Program: University of Minnesota (MN)
    -   Year: 2014 and 2015
    -   Trials: S2TP\_2014\_Crookston, S2TP\_2014\_FHB\_Crookston, S2TP\_2014\_FHB\_StPaul, S2TP\_2015\_Crookston, S2TP\_2015\_Crookston\_FHB, S2TP\_2015\_StPaul, and S2TP\_2015\_StPaul\_FHB
    -   Traits: plant height, heading date, and FHB Severity
4.  Click the "Save current selection" button.
5.  Under the "Download" tab, go to "Genotype and Phenotype Data".
6.  Make sure only the "Phenotype" box is checked.
7.  Click the "Create file" button with instructions for one column for each trait (not used by TASSEL).
8.  Click the "Download Zip file of results" button.
