# PopVarVal

## Description

Project repository for the empirical validation of PopVar. This experiment involved predicting the genetic variance ($V_G$) and superior progeny mean ($\mu_{sp}$) of a large number of simulated bi-parental crosses. Those simulated crosses with high and low predicted $V_G$ were selected and were actually created. The families will be evaluated in field trials in 2017 and 2018.
